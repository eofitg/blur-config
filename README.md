# blur config

`.blur-config.cfg`

---

- `old.cfg` : the oldest | **Do not use**
- `120to60.cfg` : from a random YouTube video (maybe owqnd i forgot)
- `240to60.cfg` : from qbedwars' render settings, it's pretty smooth but maybe a little vague
- `not-too-old.cfg`: old but still usable

The most up-to-date : `latest.cfg`
